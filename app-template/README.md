# RackStep App Template

This is a fully functional example app build using RackStep. You may use this
as the starting point to your own app.


## Dependancies

This example app was developed and tested with Ruby 2.2.3. The only hard
dependency is Rack itself, but there are a few others recommended gem
dependancies:
- unicorn: fast rack-compatible server that can be used for production.
- simplecov: a simple way to generate statistics about you unit tests coverage.


## How to

To run the app, just start a rack compatible server like rackup, shotgun or
unicorn. This app is ready to be deployed at Heroku.com.
